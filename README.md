# Rhove JavaScript Code Challenge Starter

Welcome to Rhove's JavaScript code challenge! We've already created all the boilerplate for you, so you can spend your time on solving problems rather than on setting up.

You have one week to complete this challenge and it should take you **no longer than 4 hours**. At the four-hour mark, feel free to write down any additional work you would have completed if the app was meant for production and send that along with your code challenge submission. Let us know if you have any questions, and good luck!

## Getting Started

    $ npm i
    $ npm start

## Running tests

    $ npm test

## Challenge Instructions

The requirements for your application are as follows:

1) Displays a list of four or more XKCD comic strips, acquired via the XKCD API endpoint: https://xkcd.com/json.html
2) For each comic, displays its image, title, and date published.
3) The list of comics is arranged in a grid.
4) Includes a checkbox that, when checked, sorts the comic strips by most recent to least recent.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Includes unit tests.
* `npm test` runs all existing unit tests.
* Runs in Chrome. Don't worry about browser compatibility for this challenge.
* Includes more than one commit, each with a thoughtful commit message.
* Work is logically grouped into commits.
* `npm i` downloads all dependencies.
* `npm start` runs the application.
* React components are organized into separate files.
* No console errors.
* Meets the challenge requirements.
