# Rhove JavaScript Code Challenge Starter

Welcome to Rhove's JavaScript code challenge! We've already created all the boilerplate for you, so you can spend your time solving problems rather than setting up.

You have one week to complete this challenge and it should take you **no longer than 4 hours**. We want to be respectful of your time, so at the four-hour mark, submit your challenge and go celebrate a job well-done. If there's work you would have completed if you'd had more time (and the app was meant for production), feel free to write that down and submit it along with your code. 

Let us know if you have any questions, and good luck!

## Getting Started

    $ npm i
    $ npm start

## Challenge Instructions

The requirements for your application are as follows:

1) Displays a list of at least four XKCD comics, acquired via the XKCD API endpoint: https://any-api.com:8443/http://xkcd.com/{COMIC_ID_GOES_HERE}/info.0.json (see documentation over [here](https://any-api.com/xkcd_com/xkcd_com/console/_comicId_info_0_json/GET)).
2) Each comic includes its title, date published, and image, and links to the actual comic on xkcd.com.
3) The list of comics is arranged in a grid.
4) Comics are sorted with the most recent comics first.
5) Includes a checkbox that, when checked, sorts the comic strips so the least recent comics are first.
6) When the checkbox is unchecked, the comics revert to most recent first.

**Note:** XCKD's API doesn't have CORS support. Using any-api.com's version of the API gets around this issue.

## Evaluation Criteria
